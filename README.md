# pandas-challenge

Purpose: 

- Take school and student data, clean up data, and apply various code to find: district summary, school summary, top and bottom performing schools, school spending, and school size

  1. Import and read school_complete.csv and students_complete.csv 
  2. Cleaned data
  3. Created code that would print district summary by using: the entire school data with a focus on school name, total students, math score, and reading score. Math score and reading score are split into average and % passing respectively. Both math score and reading score are used together with student count to produce % Overall Passing
  4. Create code to print out school data based on similar categories as district summary
  5. Created code to find top schools passing by focusing on % Overall Passing in descending order
  6. Created code to find bottom performing schools by focusing on % Overall Passing in ascending order
  7. Created code to find math score and ordered it by school name and grade
  8. Created code to find reading score by school name and grade
  9. Created code that utilized bins to print an output that would show average math anmd reading score, % passing for math and reading, and % overall passing and ordered them by budget per student
  10. Created a code similar to step 9 to print output that would show average math anmd reading score, % passing for math and reading, and % overall passing and ordered them by total students 
  11. Created a code that would print out the same thing as the previous steps but ordered it by school type (i.e Charter versus District)
  
  - Used: Panda/Jupyter notebook
